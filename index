            <p>I am a User Experience Designer with a background in communication and business. I've spent the last 20 years helping others identify and solve business problems. I truly enjoy the interplay of research, analysis, and creativity that takes place in UX.  <br>
                I like playing an active role in decision-making,  staying busy, experiencing variety, learning something new everyday, and overcoming challenges. <br>
                Personally, I am a mom to two amazing daughters, and a wife to a husband who is my biggest champion. I enjoy the beauty of design that is all around us and believe in seeing the potential in everyone and everything. <br>
                I am also a bit of a grammar nerd.</p>
